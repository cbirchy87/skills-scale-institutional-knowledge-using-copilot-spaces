# Risk Management Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist helps the Risk Manager systematically identify, assess, and manage project risks throughout the project lifecycle.

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: _[Enter project name]_
- **Risk Manager**: _[Name]_
- **Project Manager**: _[Name]_
- **Review Date**: _[Date]_
- **Next Review Date**: _[Date]_

## Risk Identification Checklist

### Planning Phase
- [ ] Identified technical risks (architecture, technology choices, integrations)
- [ ] Identified resource risks (team availability, skill gaps, dependencies on external teams)
- [ ] Identified schedule risks (timeline constraints, dependencies, milestone conflicts)
- [ ] Identified scope risks (unclear requirements, scope creep potential)
- [ ] Identified stakeholder risks (approval delays, competing priorities)
- [ ] Identified external risks (vendor dependencies, regulatory changes, market conditions)
- [ ] Identified security and compliance risks

### Execution Phase
- [ ] Conduct weekly risk reviews with Project Manager
- [ ] Monitor existing risks for changes in status or priority
- [ ] Identify new risks emerging from execution challenges
- [ ] Track risks related to quality, testing, and technical debt
- [ ] Assess risks from change requests and scope modifications
- [ ] Review dependency and integration point risks

### Pre-Release Phase
- [ ] Validate deployment and rollback risks are addressed
- [ ] Assess production readiness and operational risks
- [ ] Confirm communication plans for potential issues
- [ ] Review post-deployment support and monitoring risks

---

## Risk Assessment Process

For each identified risk, document:
- [ ] Unique Risk ID (e.g., RISK-001)
- [ ] Clear description of the risk
- [ ] Impact level (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Likelihood/Probability (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Risk score or priority
- [ ] Assigned owner responsible for monitoring and mitigation
- [ ] Mitigation plan with specific actions
- [ ] Contingency plan if risk materializes
- [ ] Current status (Open/In Progress/Mitigated/Closed/Materialized)

---

## Risk Mitigation Tracking

### Active Mitigation Activities
- [ ] All high-priority risks have assigned owners
- [ ] Mitigation plans are documented with specific actions and timelines
- [ ] Progress on mitigation actions is tracked regularly
- [ ] Dependencies required for mitigation are identified and managed
- [ ] Contingency plans are prepared for critical risks

### Escalation Criteria
- [ ] Defined thresholds for escalating risks to leadership
- [ ] Escalation process is documented and communicated
- [ ] Stakeholders are aware of high-impact risks

---

## Risk Communication

- [ ] Risk register is accessible to all relevant team members
- [ ] Weekly risk summary provided to Project Manager
- [ ] High-priority risks communicated to stakeholders via Communications Lead
- [ ] Risk trends and metrics shared in project status updates
- [ ] Lessons learned from materialized risks documented

---

## Risk Register Maintenance

- [ ] Risk register template is set up and accessible
- [ ] Risk register is updated weekly (minimum)
- [ ] Closed risks are archived with closure notes
- [ ] Risk metrics tracked (total risks, open/closed, by category)
- [ ] Historical risk data retained for retrospectives

---

## Retrospective and Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Document risks that materialized and their impact
- [ ] Capture effectiveness of mitigation strategies
- [ ] Identify process improvements for future risk management
- [ ] Share learnings with other teams and projects

---

## Risk Categories Reference

Use these categories to classify risks:
- **Technical**: Architecture, technology choices, technical debt, integrations
- **Resource**: Staffing, skills, availability, turnover
- **Schedule**: Timeline, dependencies, milestones
- **Scope**: Requirements clarity, scope creep, change management
- **Quality**: Testing, defects, technical debt
- **External**: Vendor, regulatory, market, environmental
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, compliance, data protection
- **Operational**: Deployment, monitoring, support, scalability
