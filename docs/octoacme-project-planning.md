1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- **Risk Manager** captures risks in the Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- **Project Manager** marks cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalates during weekly syncs
- **Risk Manager** facilitates risk reviews during planning and throughout execution
- **Change Control Coordinator** assesses how dependencies and risks impact change requests

## Change Control Process
The **Change Control Coordinator** manages changes to project scope, schedule, or resources:
- Reviews incoming change requests for completeness and clarity
- Assesses impact on timeline, budget, and existing commitments with **Project Manager**
- Coordinates approval workflow with **Product Manager** and stakeholders
- Documents approved changes and ensures project plans are updated
- Tracks change metrics to identify trends and inform process improvements
